# PayEvo Gateway API

#### REST API for integration with the PayEvo payment gateway.

---
    
The API was designed based on REST architecture, ensuring that all responses are returned in JSON format.
    
To access the API resources, you must authenticate using the **Basic Authentication** method, providing your secret key as a credential.

Your authentication keys can be found in the control panel by navigating to **Settings → API Credentials**.

After obtaining your key, include it in the request header in the Authorization field, according to the structure shown below:

**Example**

```javascript
const options = {
    method: "POST",
    url: "https://apiv2.payevo.com.br/functions/v1/transactions",
    headers: {
        authorization: 'Basic ' + new Buffer("{SECRET_KEY}").toString('base64')
    }
}
```
